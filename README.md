Temploo.js: Tiny framework for HTML template
==

Introduction
--
`Temploo.js` is a simple and extremly light javascript framework which takes the task of compiling templates. This is my attempts to see if I can make a template engine which satisfy my needs.

Usage
--
Just add `temploo.js` into your HTML document.

```html
    <script id="test1" type="text/template">
        <div id="<%=this.id%>">
            <% for(var i = 0; i < 10; i++) { %>
                <i id="id<%=i%>">HELLO</i>
            <% } %>
        </div>
    </script>

	<script type="text/javascript" src="js/temploo-0.0.1.js"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript">
        var templateStr = document.getElementById("test1").innerHTML;
        var test = temploo(templateStr);
        console.log(test({id: 10, i:3}));
    </script>
```

There are only 2 things to remember.

1: Use `temploo` functio nto compile your templates into `template` object.

2: Use `<%=â€¦ %>` to request for printing the value to template. as an example, `<%=this.id%>`. and use `<% .. %>` for your `javascript` statements. For example

```js
    <% for(var i=0; i < 10; i++) { %> HELLO <% } %>
```

Happy Templating. :)
